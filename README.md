# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project explores how various personal, social, and academic factors influence student performance, using the UCI Student Performance dataset. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that affect final grades (`G3`) through exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- **File used**: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) <---- save this as student-mat.csv at root directory
- **Attributes**: 33 features including demographics, school support, study time, failures, internet access, and alcohol consumption

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- `pandas` — data cleaning and transformation  
- `numpy` — numerical processing  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` — visualization  

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Visualizations

- Influence of **parental relationship status** on student grades by gender
- Impact of **past failures** on final grade (`G3`)
- Relation between **internet access** and academic outcome
- Effect of **family relationship quality**
- How **study time** correlates with performance
- **Correlation heatmap** of all numerical features (G1, G2, G3, absences, alcohol use, etc.)

---

## 📌 Insights

- Students with **more study hours** generally score higher.(obviously)
- **Parental separation** tends to correlate with slightly lower performance in both genders.
- Prior **failures** strongly impact current grades.
- Having **internet access** may correlate with marginally better outcomes.
- **Family relationship quality** shows slight influence, especially in males.
